    /*
    the reason is:
    - With a Worker-based actor engine, we have a fixed set of N workers
    (N normally being "reasonable" count) with 1 worker = 1 thread
    when submitting a job to the engine, it is QUEUED,
    the N workers are pulling on that queue,
    so we have max N jobs executed in parallel
    - with virtual threads the actor engine just instantly starts one thread per submitted actor-job
    ... so there is virtually no limit to the number of threads that could try to execute in parallel
    for example,
    (a) operations on servers :
    if one has 1000 http calls to make (to get feature vectors)
    it is not a good idea to make them all at the same time, especially with
    python servers that are not too good at queuing ...
    (b) operations on files, like generating many animated gifs from a movie:
    1hour movie, 5s per gif ==> 720 files to create
    in parallel ? the pressure on the file system would be too large
