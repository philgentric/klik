DO NOT USE for super confidential data/images!!! as this is NOT strong encryption (look at the code). This is intended to be good enough against the average punk who stole your hardware or your cloud credentials. For additional security, feel free to record a different pass-phrase than the default one in the source code, which, with the pin code, forms the encryption key. For this, in the .klik folder, create a file named '.passphrase.txt' and write your passphrase in it. \nIn all cases, make sure to back up the pincode (and the passphrase if you changed it) as there is NO WAY (unless you are an expert with the right hardware and a lot of time) to recover your data if you forgot/lost it\n Selecting this option will activate a new 'Fusk' menu in the 'Files' drop-down.
