This folder is obsolete, it is here for pure nostalgia.

Klik is now in full rolling releases mode : what is in the `main` branch is what you get when you download/clone Klik.

The version number is now N.0.P (for example 1.0.123)
where N is the major version, 0 is the minor version and P is the patch version. 
The patch version is simply the number of commits to the main branch.

It is recommended that you pull as often as you can, you don't need to open a shell or anything, just click the "Get most recent version" button in the Launcher.
